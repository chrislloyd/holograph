# Propagator Draw

This is a propagator network simulator on top of tldraw
Play with it live here https://holograph-1.vercel.app/

Propagator networks enable bi-directional computation via independently operating nodes. Propagators (squares) listen to changing inputs, run code, and update connected outputs.
You can make your own here.
- Put your variables in circles
- Put your JS in squares (you can write a return or not)
- Draw arrows from circles to squares with text that matches the variables
- Draw arrows from squares sot the circles to be updated.
There's lot of awesome stuff than can be made with these (maybe everything?). If you want to have fun with it, try to make a conditional or a switch. Its fun :slightly_smiling_face:
Cheers!
